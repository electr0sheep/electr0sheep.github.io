My name is Michael DeGraw.

I recently graduated from Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX with a degree in
Computer Science. My area of interest is Cyber Security, which I find
fascinating.

I also enjoy working on my car, find physics and engineering supremely
interesting, and enjoy learning Japanese as well.

I am too broke currently, but my long-term career goal is to eventually obtain
my OSCP certification, and do penetration testing. My favorite thing to do is
learn new things about Kali Linux.

Besides cryptography, I enjoy web design, specifically making lightweight
websites that load fast and look good.
