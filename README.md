## Electrosheep

### Description
* This is a custom Jekyll theme that mashes the My Stack Problems theme with the Lanyon/Poole themes.

### Demo
* [https://electr0sheep.github.io](https://electr0sheep.github.io)

#### Modifications from My Stack Problems

* No longer requires circular avatar
* Avatar is now in .png format
* Added introduction and categories to menu
* Removed feeds
* Added the menu button from Lanyon/Poole and put the menu items in there

#### Modifications from Lanyon/Poole

* Changed background color of menu
* Increased width of the menu

#### Todo

* Make the menu only appear in low resolutions: if a desktop is used, get rid of the menu altogether. The menu should be used solely for the benefit of viewing on mobile devices.
* Clean up CSS and other files (I don't think the Lanyon themes are useful, just set a menu color variable in _config.yml or something)
* Ensure that everything is as modular as possible
