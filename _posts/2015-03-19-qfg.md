Recently, I figured out how to install Quest for Glory 5 on an x86 version of windows. The solution is very simple. [Use the installer provided at this](http://sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/NewSierraInstallers.html#Q) website. It will have you insert the two discs, and afterwards, the game will be playable without the use of cds. No quicktime installations, patches, etc. Just use the installer.
