Recently, I figured out how to install Quest for Glory 5 on versions of Windows
beyond Windows 98. The solution is very simple.
[Use the installer provided at this](http://sierrahelp.com/Patches-Updates/NewSierraInstallers.html#Q)
website. It will have you insert the two discs, and afterwards, the game will be
playable without the use of cds. No quicktime installations, patches, etc. Just
use the installer.
