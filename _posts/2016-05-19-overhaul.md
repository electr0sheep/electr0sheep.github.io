So, I went to write my MySQL post, and when I committed it, nothing showed up.
I have been thinking for a while now that my blog is looking seriously outdated
for a while. So, I went ahead and gave it a good overhaul. I used
[this theme for jekyll](https://github.com/agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io), but
of course I have tweaked it a bit to conform to my rigorous code of excellence.
So far, I am really liking the new look. Soooooooo mission accomplished :)

# 8/25/2017 Update
Only thing I've retained from that theme is the category listing, albeit
modified slightly.
