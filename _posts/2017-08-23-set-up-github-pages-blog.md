This one is going to take me back, because it's been a while since I've set up
my own blog through GitHub Pages. If any information is invalid, please send me
an email at electr0sheep@electr0sheep.com. Like several of my other guides, this
will be broken up into sections.

1. [Setting up accounts](#setting-up-accounts)
2. [Set up GitHub Pages](#set-up-github-pages)

# Setting up accounts
You will need several accounts for this. So, if you don't already have an
account at each of these places, set one up.

1. [Google](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp)
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/join)
3. [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/a/sign-up)

# Set up GitHub Pages
<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
For the sake of this guide, I'll use joe as an example GitHub user. Anytime you
see "joe" I'm referring to your GitHub user.
</div>
Go to your GitHub page, e.g. https://github.com/joe. From there, click on
*Repositories*. Then click the *New* button. For the repository name, enter
*joe.github.io*. Configure the rest of the options as you see fit, but the repo
name is **NOT** optional. When you're done, hit *Create repository*.

Now, when you go back to your repositories, you should see joe.github.io. Click
it. Then, click *Settings* up top. You should see a *GitHub Pages* section. You'll
notice a *Theme Chooser* section, and you're going to want to click the *Choose a theme*
button. From there, pick whatever theme you want to rock on your blog. As for me,
I use the [Lanyon Theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) because I like simplicity.
Fair warning though, Lanyon doesn't seem to be active anymore, and I had to make
several modifications to it to make it work right.

Anyway, with all that set up, you should be able to view your blog. Go to
joe.github.io and make sure that it shows up.
