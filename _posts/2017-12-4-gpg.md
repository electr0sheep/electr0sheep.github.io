This is mostly adapted from GitHub's guide which can be found at
[https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/)
and
[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/)  
I also used this guide to import/export keys

## What is GPG?
[GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) is an acronymn for Gnu Privacy Guard. It is a
powerful tool that allows you to, among other things, set up and manage [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)
(Pretty Good Privacy) keys.

## Why should I use GPG?
The obvious answer here is that you can use it for nefarious purposes, and lots
of people probably do. But there are plenty of good reasons why you should want
to use it. I actually started using it to sign my GitHub commits, and that
highlights the primary reason I started using it, which is so that I can verify
my identity. Also, PGP operates on a web of trust. In other words, other people
that know you can verify your key, which eventually leads to a more trusted key.
So, the sooner and longer you use a PGP key, the more trusted it becomes,
essentially.

## How do I use GPG?
That is the purpose of this post, to outline this process. I will go over this
process in several steps.

1. [Installing GPG](#installing-gpg)
2. [Generating a key](#generating-a-key)
3. [Get key info](#get-key-info)
4. [Exporting your key](#exporting-your-key)
5. [Importing your key](#importing-your-key)
6. [Optional stuff](#optional-stuff)
    1. [Configure git](#configure-git)
    2. [Auto password](#auto-password)
    3. [Set up encrypted gmail](#set-up-encrypted-gmail)

# Installing GPG
This one is easy. Just download the command line tools from the [GPG site](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html)

# Generating a key
From the command line type `gpg --gen-key`. If you are not presented with a list
of options, you may need to type `gpg --full-generate-key` instead.

From the list of options, choose `RSA and RSA` by just pressing enter.

For the key size, you definitely want `4096`.

For the key expiration, just press enter to select the default of no expiration.

Enter your user information as prompted.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
If you want to use your key to sign GitHub commits, you need to enter the
primary email for your GitHub account.
</div>

Finally, type a secure passphrase to complete the process.

# Get key info
To list your keys use the following command
`gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG`

Take special note of what follows after the slash, that is the key ID. For
example
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
sec   4096R/<b><i>3AA5C34371567BD2</i></b> 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10]
</code>

Copy that ID, and then use the following command to print your public key in the
terminal, replacing my example ID with yours of course.
`gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2`

You can use this command to print your private key in the terminal
`gpg --armor --export-secret-key 3AA5C34371567BD2`

# Exporting your key
If you would like to create a file from the previous output you can use the
following commands, renaming mygpgkey_pub.gpg and mygpgkey_sec.gpg to whatever
you would like, and of course using your key ID and not my example one.
`gpg --output mygpgkey_pub.gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2`  
`gpg --output mygpgkey_sec.gpg --armor --export-secret-key 3AA5C34371567BD2`

# Importing your key
If you have multiple machines/virtual machines/whatever, you may want to export
and import these keys so that you can verify your identity no matter which
machine you are using.

Once you have exported your public/private key pair to files, as outlined above,
it is easy to import them. From the folder that contains your keys, use these
commands

`gpg --import mygpgkey_pub.gpg`  
`gpg --import mygpgkey_sec.gpg`

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
If importing your secret key doesn't work, you may need to add the option
--allow-secret-key-import. However, that options is deprecated, and recent
versions of GPG won't make use of it.
</div>

# Optional stuff

## Configure git
<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
GitHub Desktop does not support signing commits yet. So, if you'd rather use
that than command line git, this section is useless.

However, I recommend that
you make it a priority to familiarize yourself with command line git if you are
wanting to be a serious programmer. You will almost assuredly be using the Linux
platform at some point, and as of this writing, there is no GitHub Desktop app
for any Linux distro.
</div>
To have git automatically sign your commits, the process is very easy.
First, you need to your key ID which if you've forgotten how to get that, refer
to the [Get key info section](#get-key-info). Once you have it, use this command
to have git sign all commits `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`. Then,
you'll need to tell git which key to use by default using this command,
replacing my example key ID with yours
`git config --global user.signingkey 3AA5C34371567BD2`
Finally, if you are using a program to store your passwords so you don't have to
type it every time, there is a git option that allows you to specify this. In
the case of Windows, I use [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/), which is the
official GPG distribution for Windows. To specify this program as the default
gpg program I used the following command
`git config --global gpg.program "C:/Program Files (x86)/GnuPG/bin/gpg.exe"`
<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
Because that last command has a space in it, those quotation marks aren't optional.
</div>

Now, all of this will amount to nothing if you don't import your public key into
GitHub. From your GitHub profile settings page, select SSH and GPG keys from the
left menu. Now, select the New GPG key button, and copy/paste your public key
ASCII text here.

## Auto password
If you like automatic passwords (like me), you'll want to use some optional
GPG software. For Windows, I recommend [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/),
which is the official GPG distribution for Windows. For Macs, I recommend
[GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/), which integrates into KeyChain.

## Set up encrypted gmail
There is an extension for chrome that makes this super easy. It's called [FlowCrypt](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flowcrypt-encrypt-gmail-w/bnjglocicdkmhmoohhfkfkbbkejdhdgc?hl=en).
Once you have it installed, it works with both Gmail and Inbox, so if you go to
either one, you'll notice a banner that will guide you in the setup process,
which will guide you in the process of setting it up. If you need to, you can
refer to the [Get key info section](#get-key-info) to help you with printing
your key information so you can copy it to FlowCrypt.
