I literally just discovered something. First, that I don't know how to correctly
use the word "literally".

Also...

To show the 'library' folder in osx, navigate to your home folder, right click
on some empty space, click "show view options" from the popup menu, then you
will see a check box for "Show library Folder".

No crazy terminal wizardry required!
