title: MySQL on OSX

I have recently been learning about PHP, and MySQL, and I wanted to document the
steps I had to go through to get up to speed. Here is how to get MySQL going on
OSX:

1. Install homebrew
2. Install MySQL
3. Starting and stopping MySQL server
4. Connect to MySQL server
5. Add a user
6. Create database
7. Give user permissions
8. Reconnect to MySQL using new user
9. Create new table
10. Do whatever else you want

### Install homebrew
Easy. Open up your terminal and type

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


### Install MySQL
Even easier. With homebrew installed type

    brew install mysql

### Start MySQL server
Also easy. From your terminal with MySQL installed type

    mysqld

The d means it will open as a daemon process. To shut down the server, type

    mysqladmin -u root shutdown

### Connect to MySQL server
From terminal...in fact, just assume everything is in the terminal from now on.

    mysql -u root

### Add user
Assuming all has gone well, you should now be in a mysql shell. If you see ```mysql>```
then you are. There is some misinformation on the internet regarding this
process. Don't be fooled. You shouldn't be opening up tables and adding crap to
them. To add a user is simple. Let's set up a user named guest with password
guest123.

    create user 'guest'@'localhost' identified by 'guest123';

Incidentally, it's simple to remove users

    drop user 'guest'@'localhost';

### Create database
Now, this user can't do much currently. In fact, guest can't do anything right
now. We need to create a database.

    create database example;

### Give user permissions
We need to add permission for guest to do stuff to the database, which we named example.

    grant select, insert, update, delete, create, drop on example.* to 'guest'@'localhost' identified by 'guest123';

Finally, and this IS IMPORTANT, we need to flush privileges. Privileges are
kinda like poop, and it needs to be flushed from time to time.

    flush privileges;

### Reconnect to MySQL using new user
Now, it's time to see if we did everything right. Go ahead and exit the MySQL shell.

    exit

Now let's try to login with our new user

    mysql -u guest -p

Now type in your password at the prompt: guest123
Alternatively, you can just include the password as an argument, although you will be yelled at, called various names, and be told that doing so is insecure.

    mysql -u guest -pguest123

NOTE: there is no space between p and the password

### Create new table
If all went well, you should now be logged back in. Let's check out what databases are available to us.

    show databases;

Hopefully you see our example database. Let's use it.

    use example;

Let's add a simple table.

    create table stuff (id int not null primary key auto_increment);

This table doesn't do much, but who cares. Let's make sure it's actually there.

    show tables;

### Do whatever else you want
There's lots of stuff you can do with MySQL, including getting the crap SQL injected out of you. Here are some good places to look:

 - [More in depth tutorial, but at times inaccurate](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql/index.htm)
 - [Check out what users you have in your databases](http://alvinalexander.com/blog/post/mysql/show-users-i-ve-created-in-mysql-database)
 - And the list goes on and on
