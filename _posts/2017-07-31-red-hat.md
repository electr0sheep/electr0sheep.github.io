title: Set up Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a thumb drive (for MacBooks)
category: linux

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
The RHEL package manager is `yum`  
RHEL packages are `.rpm` files, as opposed to `.deb` files for Debian
</div>

With Kali Linux recently installed, let's also set up Red Hat on a thumb drive.
<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
I don't believe you can easily set up a RHEL live drive like you could with Kali.
The biggest thing to consider is that RHEL will be configured specifically to
the hardware that it was installed on. However, I was able to get it to boot on
three different machines, including one with a Ryzen processor.

# Get the RHEL install iso

# Install RHEL to a thumb drive

# Set up a RHEL subscription
<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Red Hat keeps a pretty tight lid on their subscriptions. They have a built-in
tool called 'Red Hat Subscription Manager', but if you go to the [Systems page](https://access.redhat.com/management/systems)
on their website, you can find more detailed information, particularly if you
encounter any issues while setting the subscriptions up.

# Optional fun stuff

## Install Google Chrome
This one is actually easy. Just go to the chrome download page and install the
.rpm file. Once downloaded, double click it and install the app through the
`software` program.
