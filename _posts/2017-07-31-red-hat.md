title: Set up Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a thumb drive (for MacBooks)
category: linux
---

With Kali Linux recently installed, let's also set up Red Hat on a thumb drive.
<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
I don't believe you can easily set up a RHEL live drive like you could with Kali.
The biggest thing to consider is that RHEL will be configured specifically to
the hardware that it was installed on. However, I was able to get it to boot on
three different machines, including one with a Ryzen processor.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Red Hat keeps a pretty tight lid on their subscriptions. They have a built-in
tool called 'Red Hat Subscription Manager', but if you go to the [Systems page](https://access.redhat.com/management/systems)
on their website, you can find more detailed information, particularly if you
encounter any issues while setting the subscriptions up.
