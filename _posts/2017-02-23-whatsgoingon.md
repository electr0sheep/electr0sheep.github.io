## Seriously, what's with all the clutter?
First off, this is pretty much my experimental grounds. Basically, the way it
works is, I get an idea in my head like, "Wouldn't it be cool if I had a
background image?" and I just roll with it. In other words, I definitely haven't
carefully designed my blog.

In my opinion, there is nothing better than simplicity, which this so-called
blog obviously lacks. What I am referring to are things like Material Design,
and Apple's redesign of OSX starting with Yosemite. The difference here is that
the colors are very plain, whereas before it seems like people preferred, for
lack of a better word, things to be shiny. I personally thought Mavericks looked
like crap, and was stoked when I installed the beta of Yosemite and found that
it was more Material Design-ish.

For an example of a blog that I would consider well-designed, [head on over to
my brother's blog](https://catskull.net).

So yeah, sorry for all the clutter, but honestly, I think I'm the only one who
ever looks at this crap, which is why I have stated in this very blog that I
will primarily use it for my own benefit. My posts are primarily about things I
struggled with, like tweaking bootcamp, and things I find interesting, like
unlocking locked systems.

Not anymore! I got back to my roots and ditched all that crap. My blog is
*killing* it now!
