I decided to do yet another overhaul of my blog. This time around, I had a look
at everything and asked myself "Does this greatly enhance the user experience?"
If the answer was anything other than "Absolutely", I trashed it. Needless to
say, most everything got trashed.

* The Material Floating Button
* The stupid footer
* The search in the menu
* General tom-foolery going on in the menu
* The stupid background image
* Disqus

One thing I plan on adding to the menu is a "Categories" feature, just so
~~viewers~~ I can more easily find things without going through the whole list
of posts.

Now, what is the end-game for me here? Well my friend, I proudly present to you

And also

Now, the real question is why did I get rid of Disqus? Well, Disqus was causing
JavaScript errors, and also was triggering uBlock. Also, I have no delusions of
grandeur, and no one besides myself had ever used it. Also, my email is listed
in the about section. So, if anyone really needs to contact me, they can use
that channel. Until Disqus stops triggering uBlock, and giving me JavaScript
errors, I wouldn't count on seeing it again.
