So, you decided you like VIM, but you need line numbering and syntax
highlighting?


Fear not, this is an easy enough fix. First, fire up VIM and run `:version`. At
the very bottom, you'll see a line containing _user vimrc file:_. Take not of
that location, then exit VIM and create the vimrc file in that location (if it
doesn't already exist) `vim location/.vimrc`. Add the following lines to it.

```
:set number
:syntax on
```
