So a last black Friday, my brothers and I went on a frantic search to get some
new Nintendo 3DSes for $100. We got them, and of course I wanted to hack that
sucker. So, if you're thinking the same thing, (head on over to 3ds.guide)[http
://3ds.guide] for all the info you need. The process isn't as easy as going
to a specific website, like it is for the PsVita, but all in all it really
wasn't all that bad.
