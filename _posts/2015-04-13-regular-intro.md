So, my brother was like "Hey, you have a different category for every post you made, including the Star Trek one that basically contains nothing." And I was like...yeah I guess that's a good point. SO, my solution is to make a category for random posts, and if things start to get similar, I can pull them out and put them in their own category. This way, less clicky, more ready. Not that there's a whole lot here to read currently...but anyway...electrosheep out.
