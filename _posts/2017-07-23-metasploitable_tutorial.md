This tutorial assumes you have a metasploitable virtual machine installed
correctly (with network ports visible) and that you will be using Kali Linux to
assess vulnerabilities.

This post is a WIP, but I will link several resources you can use while I figure
out what I am doing myself.

There are some great Metasploit/Metasploitable tutorials [here](http://www.hackingtutorials.org/metasploit-tutorials/).  
There are also some good tutorials on using some of Kali's many tools [here](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-databases-hacking-mysql-online-databases-with-sqlmap-0150368/).  

Furthermore, I have posted links to the pdfs of my cybersecurity class labs.  
[Lab 1](public/files/LAB1.pdf)  
*An introduction to the different modes of operation used by symmetric ciphers*  
[Lab 2](public/files/LAB2.pdf)  
*An introduction to WPA passphrase cracking*  
[Lab 3](public/files/LAB3.pdf)  
*An introduction to asymmetric ciphers and how they compare to symmetric ciphers*  
[Lab 4](public/files/LAB4.pdf)  
*An introduction to certificate authorities*  
[Lab 5](public/files/Lab5.pdf)  
*A MITM attack on TLS/SSL*  

# Future
I want to play with Metasploitable 3, which is different in that whereas
Metasploitable 2 has a tendency to be a little too easy to exploit (exploitable
using a single module), Metasploitable 3 isn't quite so easy. Another key
feature of Metasploitable 3 is that it is open source. A downside is that
Metasploitable 3 must be built manually. More info [here](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2016/11/15/test-your-might-with-the-shiny-new-metasploitable3). The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/).
